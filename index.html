  <h2>Cities I've lived in</h2>
  <p>I grew up in Atlanta, and lived in Biloxi and COS because of the military</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Atlanta</li>
    <li>Colorado Springs</li>
    <li>Biloxi</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Cities I want to visit</h2>
  <p>I would greatly enjoy visiting Tokyo, as I've always wanted to visit Japan. My wife has always wanted to visit London, and Dale is a fictional city in The Hobbit. Of course I'd want to go there!</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Tokyo</li>
    <li>Dale</li>
    <li>London</li>
